LangChain is a framework designed to simplify the development of applications powered by large language models (LLMs).

It provides building blocks for common use cases such as chatbots, question answering systems, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

One of the core ideas of LangChain is to connect language models with external data sources.

This is achieved by loading documents, splitting them into smaller chunks, generating embeddings, and storing them in vector databases.

Vector databases allow semantic search, meaning that queries are matched based on meaning rather than exact keywords.

PGVector is a PostgreSQL extension that enables storing and searching vector embeddings directly in a relational database.

Using PGVector with LangChain allows developers to build production-ready RAG systems with persistence, scalability, and SQL support.

Indexing is the process of transforming raw documents into searchable vector representations.

Retrieval is the process of querying those vectors to find the most relevant information for a user question.
