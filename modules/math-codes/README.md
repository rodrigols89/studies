## Arithmetic

> Arithmetic is the branch of mathematics that deals with the basic operations and properties of numbers, including *addition*, *subtraction*, *multiplication*, *division*, and their combinations. **It mainly focuses on direct numerical calculations and manipulation of concrete quantities**.

## Algebra

> Algebra is the branch of mathematics that uses **"symbols"** and **"letters"** to represent numbers and unknown quantities, **"called variables"**. It deals with equations, algebraic expressions, and relationships between quantities, allowing for the generalization of mathematical patterns and the solution of complex problems. Algebra studies abstract structures and the properties of operations on these structures.
