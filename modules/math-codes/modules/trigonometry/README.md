## Rays and Angles

Before learning about **Angles**, we need to understand **Rays**.

> A **"Ray"** is a directed line segment.

For example, see the **Ray** below:

![img](images/ray-01.jpeg)

See that a ***"Ray"*** has:

 - **An "Endpoint":** The first point is called the *"endpoint"* of the *"Ray"*
   - The starting point of the ray.
 - **A "Direction":** We can also define the direction of the *"Ray"*
   - We define a arrow under the endpoint and the final point: $\overrightarrow{EF}$
   - **NOTE:** See that is similar to a Vector.

<!---
\overrightarrow{EF}

> An **"Angle"** is the **"union of two rays"** having a *common endpoint*.

For example, see the **"Angle"** below:

![img](images/ray-02.jpeg)  

See that:

 - **We have an endpoint "E":**
   - Common to rays **"D"** and **"F"**.
 - **Two rays "D" and "F" have a common endpoint "E".**
 - **The endpoint "E" is called the "vertex" of the angle:**
   - And the two rays are the sides of the angle.
 - **The angle to our image is formed:**
   - From $\overrightarrow{ED}$ and $\overrightarrow{EF}$

## Angle: Initial and Terminal sides

Angle creation is a **dynamic process**... We start with two rays lying on top of one another.

 - **We leave one fixed in place:**
   - The fixed ray is the *"initial side"*
 - **And rotate the other:**
   - The rotated ray is the *"terminal side"*.

In order to identify the different sides, we indicate the rotation with a small arrow close to the vertex as the image below:

![img](images/angle-01.jpeg)

<div id="measure-of-angles"></div>

## Measure of Angles

> The **measure of an angle** is the **amount of rotation from the initial side to the terminal side**.

Probably the most familiar unit of angle measurement is the **"degree"**.

 - One **degree** is $\frac{1}{360}$ of a circular rotation.
 - So a complete circular rotation contains **360 degrees**.

> **NOTE:**  
> An angle measured in degrees should always include the unit “degrees” after the number, or include the degree symbol `°`.

For example:

```bash
90 degrees = 90°
```

 - If the angle is measured in a **"counterclockwise direction"** from the initial side to the terminal side, the angle is said to be a **"positive angle"**.
 - If the angle is measured in a **"clockwise direction"**, the angle is said to be a **"negative angle"**.

For example, see the images below to understand more easily:

![img](images/measure-of-angles-01.png)  

To place the terminal side of the angle, we must calculate the fraction of a full rotation the angle represents. We do that by dividing the angle measure in degrees by **"360°"**.

For example:

 - To draw a **"90°"** angle, we calculate that $\frac{90}{360} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25$.
   - So, the terminal side will be *one-fourth* of the way around the circle, moving counterclockwise from the positive x-axis.
 - To draw a **"360°"** angle, we calculate that $\frac{360}{360} = 1$.

See the image below to understand more easily:

![img](images/measure-of-angles-02.png)  

It's common to learn that angles can be measured in degrees:

![img](images/measure-of-angles-03.png)  

> **NOTE:**  
> Looking at the image above, pay attention that the focus is on the **“angles”** and **"not the number of radius"**.

See the image again to understand the focus more easily:

![img](images/measure-of-angles-04.png)  

See that:

 - **We have many Angles in degree.**
 - **The blue Circle is the ["Unit Circle"](#Unit-Circle):**
   - Has a *"radius of 1"*.
   - Is centered at the *"origin (0, 0)"*.

For example, let's see some of these angles above separated:

## Angles and Greek Letters

> **Greek letters** are often (frequentemente) used as variables for the measure of an angle.

For example, see the common Greek letters used to measure angles:

| θ     | φ or ϕ | α     | β    | γ     |
|-------|--------|-------|------|-------|
| Theta | Phi    | Alpha | Beta | Gamma |

## Components of a Circle

To work with a **Circle** we have some important components:

![img](images/circle-components-01.png)  

 - **Center of the circle (Central Vertex):**
   - The center is the fixed point inside the circle that is the same distance away from all points on the circle's edge (circumference). 
 - **Circumference:**
   - The circumference is the total length around (bounded) the edge of the circle.
 - **Radius:**
   - The radius is any line segment that connects the center of the circle to a point on the edge (circumference). All **radii (radii = plural of radius, it's the plural form of radius, indicating there are more than one of these lines)** of a circle have the same length.
 - **Diameter:**
   - The diameter is a straight line that passes through the center of the circle (0, 0) and touches opposite ends of the circle's edge. **Its length is equal to twice the radius**.

**NOTE:**  
Now let's look at some components of a circle that may look the same but are different:

 - **Radius (Raio):**
   - A **Radius (Raio)** is a line segment that starts from the *center of the circle (0, 0)* and ends on a point on the circle's edge (circumference).
   - It's typically denoted by the letter **"r"** in mathematical formulas.
 - **Ray (Também é "raio" em inglês):**
   - A **Ray (Também é "raio" em inglês)** is a part of a line that starts at the *center of the circle (0, 0)* and *"extends infinitely"* outward in one direction. 
 - **Arc:**
   - Part of the *circumference* of a *circle*.

## Unit Circle

When we study Angles, it is common to draw a circle between the rays to find the Angle.

> This circle is known as the **"Unit Circle"**.

 - A **"Unit Circle"** is a circle *"on the Cartesian Plane"* that *"has a radius of 1 unit"*.
 - And is *centered* at the *origin (0, 0)*.

![img](images/unit-circle-01.png)  

See that our circle:

 - Has a *"radius of 1"*.
 - Is centered at the *"origin (0, 0)"*.

**NOTE:**  
Pay attention that, the focus here is the *"circle"*, not the arcs (or rays) length. That's the circle with a radius of 1.

## Radius and Radian as a measure

> A **Radius** is **half a diameter**.

![img](images/radius-01.png)  

> **NOTE:**  
> Knowing that we can say that the *"radius"* is the *"diameter divided by two"*.

A Circle can have an uncountable number of Radius. For example:

![img](images/radius-02.png)

Looking at the first Circle, we see that we have many Radii with different spaces between them, but they all have the same length.

### Radian

I like to say (but not formally) that:

> A **"Radian"** is an **"Angle"** in which the *Arc* has the same length as the *Radius*.

![img](images/radian-01.gif)  

> **What would happen if we were to rotate around the circle continuing to add radians?**

![img](images/radian-02.png)  

See that:

 - **We have 6 radians.**
   - And a little bit more.
 - **These 6 radians can be used to measure angles:**
   - That is, now we use *"radians"* instead of *"degrees"* to measure angles.

<div id="degrees-to-radians"></div>

## Degrees to Radians

To understand how to convert degrees into radians, first let's consider that a complete rotation of the circle (circumference) is:

 - **Degrees:**
   - 360° (or 360 degrees)
 - **Radians:**
   - 2π (or 2π radians)

For example, see the image below:

![img](images/degrees-to-radians-01.png)

Knowing that we can say also that the half of a circle is:

 - **360° (or 360 degrees) divided by 2:**
   - 180° (or 180 degrees)
 - **2π (or 2π radians) divided by 2:**
   - 1rad (or 1π radian) = π

For example, see the image below:

![img](images/degrees-to-radians-02.png)

And If I divide 360° into 4 equal parts?

![img](images/degrees-to-radians-03.png)

> **Ok, but how do you use that to convert degrees into radians?**

We can use **"proportions"** to solve this problem. For example:

> **How do you convert 30° (or 30 degrees) into radians?**

Using proportions we have:

![img](images/degrees-to-radians-04.png)

That is, **30° (or 30 degrees)** equals **Pi/6 radians**.

$30° = \frac{\pi}{6}$

> **NOTE:**  
> That is, we can use the *"proportions"* approach to solve any problem to convert degrees into radians.

<div id="radians-to-degrees"></div>

## Radians to Degrees

Ok, now how to convert radians into degrees? For example:

> **Imagine we need to convert $\frac{3\pi}{4}$ to degrees.**

Well, we know that **Pi (π) = 180°**... Knowing that we can change the question to:

![img](images/radians-to-degrees-01.png)

Now, we can work like an equation to solve that:

![img](images/radians-to-degrees-02.png)

## Degrees and Radians Circle/Table

Now, let's see a Circle/Table with Degrees and corresponding Radians:

 - **The angle is often labeled (frequentemente rotulado) *"θ"*, and the three sides are then called:**
   - **Opposite:** opposite to the angle **θ**.
   - **Adjacent:** adjacent (next to) the angle **θ**.
   - **Hypotenuse:** The longest side is the *Hypotenuse*.

![img](images/sine-02.png)  

Find the value of **sin t**:

 - The side **opposite** to the angle **t** is **7**.
 - And the **hypotenuse** of the triangle is **15**.
 - Then, **sin(t) = 7/25**.

> **Ok, but why the Sine formula is (Opposite/Hypotenuse)?**

For example, given the triangle below:

![img](images/cosine-02.png)  

Find the value of **cos α**:

 - The side **adjacent** to the angle is **15**.
 - And the **hypotenuse** of the triangle is **17**.
 - Then, **cos(α) = 15/17**.
