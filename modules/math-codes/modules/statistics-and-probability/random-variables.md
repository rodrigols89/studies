## Intro to Random Variables

> A **Random Variable** is the numerical description of the **outcome of Random Experiment**.

We mathematical denote a *Random Variable* how:

 - **Y (uppercase):**
   - Denote the *Random Variable*:
     - Think this like an idea.
 - **y (lowercase:):**
   - Denote realized values from the Random Variable:
     - That is, particular values that the Random Variable can assume.

For example, imagine we toss two dice (honest), our **Random Variable (Y)** will be:

```
Y = "número de resultados cara (C)"
```

**NOTE:**  
The **particular values (y)** that our *Random Variable* (Y) can assume is:

 - See we have possible values to our *Random Variable (Y)* inside a *sample space (Ω)*.
 - And *particular values (y)* that our *Random Variable (Y)* can assume in a one-dimensional plane.

## Types of Random Variables (Discrete vs. Continuous)

> The **type of Random Variable** is *intrinsically* **related to sample space (Ω)** of the Random Variable.

For example, we have two *sample space (Ω)* types:

 - **DISCRETE SAMPLE SPACE:**
   - Contains only a **finite** or **countable** number of elements.
 - **CONTINUOUS SAMPLE SPACE:**
   - Contains an **infinite** or **uncountable** number of elements.

Based on these **types of sample spaces** we have the following **types of Random Variables**:

 - **DISCRETE RANDOM VARIABLE:**
   - A Random Variable is *discrete* **when your sample space (Ω) is discrete**.
 - **CONTINUOUS RANDOM VARIABLE:**
   - A Random Variable is *continuous* **when your sample space (Ω) is continuous**.
