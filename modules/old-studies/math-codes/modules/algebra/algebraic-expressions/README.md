## Operator Precedence AKA Order of Operations

There are situations in algebra when more than one operator is used in an expression. We must now determine which operation to do first.

 - Anything in `parentheses ()` and `brackets {}` is calculated first, regardless of the operator inside.
 - *Exponents* and *square roots* are calculated second.
 - Third, *Multiplications* and *divisions*
 - Finally, we have the addition and subtraction.

For example, imagine we have the following expression:

$8 \div 2 (2 + 2)$

First, we need to solve the `parentheses ()`:

$8 \div 2 \cdot 4$

> **The division and multiplication have the same order of operations. How to solve that?**

**NOTE:**  
If the algebraic expression contains the same order of priority, the expression will be evaluated from **left to right (leftâž”right)**:

For example:

$8 \div 2 \cdot 4$  
$4 \cdot 4 = 16$
