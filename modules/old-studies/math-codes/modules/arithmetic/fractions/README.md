## Proper Fractions

> A fraction is `proper` if the **numerator is "smaller than" the denominator**.

For example:

## Improper Fractions

> A fraction is `improper` if the **numerator is "greater than" the denominator**.

## How to convert an "Improper Fraction" to a "Mixed Fraction"

To convert an **"Improper Fraction"** to a **"Mixed Fraction"**, we need to:

 - Divide the numerator by the denominator.
 - The whole number is the integer part of the mixed number.
 - **NOTE:** The remainder is the numerator of the Mixed Fraction (new fraction).
 - **NOTE:** The denominator stays the same.

For example:

## Mixed Fractions

> A `Mixed Fraction` is a *combination* of **whole (todo)** and **part (parte)**.

## How to convert a "Mixed Fraction" to an "Improper Fraction"

To convert a **"Mixed Fraction"** to an **"Improper Fraction"**, we need to:

 - Multiply the integer by the denominator.
 - And add the numerator.

For example:

![img](images/mixed-to-improper-01.png)  

 - This gives the numerator of the Improper Fraction.
 - And the denominator stays the same.

<div id="intro-to-like-fractions"></div>

## Like Fractions

> When we have two or more fractions with the *same denominator*, we call them `Like Fractions`.

For example:

![img](images/like-fraction-01.png)





---

<div id="intro-to-unlike-fractions"></div>

## Unlike Fractions

> When we have two or more fractions with the *different denominators*, we call them `Unlike Fractions`.

<div id="add-like-fractions"></div>

## Adding fractions with the same denominators (Like Fractions)

> To add two or more fractions with the *same denominators* we only **repeat the denominator** and **sum the numerators**.

For example:
