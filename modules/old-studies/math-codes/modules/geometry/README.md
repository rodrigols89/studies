<!--- ( Circles ) -->

<div id="arc"></div>

### Arcs

> The **Arc** is a part of the *circumference* of a *circle*.

![img](images/arc-01.png)  

---

<div id="radius"></div>

### Radius (Raio)

> The **Radius (raio)** is *half of the diameter*.

![img](images/radius-01.png)  

**NOTE:**  
That's, a **Radius (raio)** is the distance between the circle center to any point on the circumference.

Another definition of **Radius (raio)** is:

> A **Radius (raio)** is the line drawn from the centre of the circle to any point on the boundary (limite) of the circle.

![img](images/radius-02.png)  

Following this definition we can say that:

> A *circle* can have an uncountable number of **Radius (raios)**.

![img](images/radius-03.png)

<div id="radians"></div>

### Radians (Radianos)

> A **Radian (Radiano)** is an Arc that has the same length as the radius.

![img](images/radian-gif-01.gif)  

**NOTE:**  
We know that a unit circle has a radius length of 1. That means that for a unit circle 1 radian will have an arc with the length of 1:

![img](images/radian01.png)  

**NOTE:**  
Another note is 1 Radian (Radiano) is about (cerca de) 57,2958 degrees:

![img](images/radian-02.png)  

> **Why "57,2958..." degrees?** 

Let us see because **1 Radian** is equal to **57,2958... degrees**:

![img](images/radian-gif-02.gif)  

In a *half circle (semicírculo)* there are *π radians*, which is also *180°*:

![img](images/radians-02.png)  

 - **To go from radians to degrees:**
   - Multiply by **180**, divide by **Pi π**.
 - **To go from degrees to radians:**
   - Multiply by **Pi π**, divide by **180**.

Here is a table of equivalent values:

<!--- ( Angles ) -->

---

<div id="clockwise-counterclockwise"></div>

### Clockwise and Counterclockwise

**NOTE:**  
Before *diving headfirst (cair de cabeça)* into the study of *Angles*, let's learning about ***Clockwise and Counterclockwise***.

**Clockwise** means moving in the *direction of the hands on a clock*. For example, see the image below to understand more easily

![img](images/clockwise.png)

> **NOTE:**  
> Most screws and bolts are tightened, and faucets/taps are closed, by turning clockwise.

![img](images/clockwise-closed.png)

 - The opposite direction is called **Counterclockwise in the US**.
 - **Anticlockwise in the UK**.
 - Or the less common but pretty cool **widdershins**!

**Compass bearings (rumos da bússola)** also are measured Clockwise:

![img](images/compass-bearing.png)

#### Angles use Counterclockwise

However, **Angles** from a line are measured Counterclockwise *(and a negative angle goes Clockwise)*:

![img](images/positive-negative-angle.png)

> **So which way?**

 - **Clockwise:**
   - Clock hands go clockwise.
   - Taps are closed clockwise.
   - Screws are tightened clockwise.
   - Compass bearings go clockwise.
 - **Counterclockwise:**
   - But **Angles are measured Counterclockwise**.

**Abbreviation:**  
Such long words deserve to be shortened:

 - So Clockwise can be shortened to **CW**.
 - And CounterClockWise to **CCW** *(or maybe ACW for anticlockwise)*.

<div id="angle-parts"></div>

### Parts of an Angle

 - The **corner (canto)** point of an angle is called the **vertex**.
 - The two **straight sides (lados retos)** are called **arms**.

For example, see the image below to understand more easily:

![img](images/angle-02.png)  

> **NOTE:**  
> The Angle is the amount of turn between each arm.

---

<div id="label-angles"></div>

### How to Label Angles

There are two main ways to label angles:

 - Give the Angle a name, usually a lower-case letter like **a** or **b**, or sometimes a Greek letter like **α (alpha)** or **θ (theta)**.
 - Or by the three letters on the shape that define the angle, with the middle letter being where the angle actually is (its vertex).

Example, the Angle **"a"** is **"BAC"**; And Angle **"θ"** is **"BCD"**:

![img](images/angle-03.png)

<div id="angles-names"></div>

### Names of Angles

As the **Angle** increases, the name changes. For example, see the **Angles** names by size below:

![img](images/angle-01.png)  

---

<div id="angle-degrees"></div>

### Angle degrees

We can measure Angles in **degrees**. For example, see the image below:

![img](images/angle-04.gif)  
![img](images/angle-04-01.png)  

There are **360 degrees in one Full Rotation** *(one complete circle around)*.

**The degree symbol  "°"**  
We use a little circle **"°"** following the number to mean degrees.

> **NOTE:**  
> For example **90°** means **90 degrees**.




































































































<!--- ( Triangles ) -->

---

<div id="triangles"></div>

## Triangles

 - A *Triangle* has **THREE SIDES** and **THREE ANGLES**:
   - **NOTE:** The **THREE ANGLES** always **ADD (SOMAM 180°) TO 180°**.

For example, see the **Triangle** below:

![img](images/triangle-gif-01.gif)  

See that:

 - **The triangle above has:**
   - Three sides.
   - Theree Angles.
   - Finally, the sum of all angles has been always 180° regardless of how I move the angles.

---

<div id="triangle-names"></div>

### Triangle names

There are three special **names** given to triangles that tell **how many sides (or angles) are equal**:

![img](images/triangle-names.png)  

 - **How to remember? Alphabetically they go 3, 2, none:**
   - **Equilateral:** "equal"-lateral (lateral means side) so they have all equal sides.
   - **Isosceles:** means "equal legs", and we have two legs, right? Also *Isosceles* has two equal "Sides" joined by an "Odd" side.
   - **Scalene:** means "uneven" or "odd", so no equal sides.

---

<div id="triangle-perimeter"></div>

### Triangle perimeter

> **The *triangle perimeter* is the distance around the edge (borda, beira, margem) of the triangle:** Just add up the three sides.

For example, see the image below:

![img](images/triangle-gif-02.gif)  

See that:

 - **EN -** Note that the wider the sides of the triangle, the larger the perimeter.
 - **PT -** Veja que, quantos mais largo os lados do triângulo, maior o perímetro.

---

<div id="triangle-area"></div>

### Triangle area

> **The *triangle area* is half of the base times height.**  

For example:

 - **"b (base)"** is the distance along the base.
 - **"h (height)"** is the height (measured at right angles to the base/medida em ângulos retos com a base).

The **formula** to the **Triangle area** is:

![img](images/triangle-area.jpg)  

> **NOTE:**  
> The formula works for all triangles.

![img](images/triangle-area-02.png)  

 - **EN -** The base can be any side, just be sure the "height" is measured at right angles to the "base".
 - **PT -** A base pode ser qualquer lado, apenas certifique-se de que a "altura" seja medida em ângulos retos com a "base".

<div id="right-angled-triangles"></div>

## Right-Angled Triangles

> A **Right-Angled Triangle** (also called a **right triangle**) is a triangle with a *right angle (90°)* in it.

**NOTE:**  
The **little square** in the corner (canto) tells us it is a right angled triangle:

![img](images/right-triangle.png)  

 - **The right angled triangle is one of the most useful shapes in all of mathematics:**
   - Pythagoras Theorem;
   - Sine;
   - Cosine;
   - Tangent...

<!--- ( Pi (π) ) -->

---

<div id="pi"></div>

## Pi (π)

The definition of **Pi (π)** is:

> The ***Pi (π)*** is the **circumference** divided by the **diameter** of a *circle*.

For example, see the image below to understand more easily:

![img](images/pi-01.png)  

See that:

 - We have a **circle**.
   - The ***circle*** have:
     - A *circumference*;
     - A *diameter*.
 - And ***Pi (π)*** is **circumference/diameter**.

> **NOTE:**  
> The *Circumference* divided by the *diameter* of a circle is always **Pi (π)**, no matter how large or small the circle is!

![img](images/pi-dia-simple.png)

<div id="finding-circumference-using-pi"></div>

### Finding a Circumference using Pi (π)

We can use **Pi (π)** to find a **Circumference** when we know the **Diameter**. The formula is:

![img](images/finding-circumference.png)  

For example, imagine you walk around a circle which has a **diameter of 100 m**, how far have you walked?

![img](images/finding-circumference-02.png)

<div id="finding-diameter-using-pi"></div>

### Finding a Diameter using Pi (π)

Also we can use **Pi (π)** to find a **Diameter** when we know the **Circumference**. The formula is:

![img](images/finding-diameter-01.png)  

For example, imagine you **measured 94 mm around the outside of a pipe**... what is its **diameter**?
