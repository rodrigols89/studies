## Intro to CatBoost

 - **Catboost (short for Categorical Boosting)** is an open-source machine learning library that provides a fast and reliable implementation of gradient boosting on decision trees algorithm **(gradient boosted decision trees)**.
 - Gradient boosted trees is a type of gradient booting machines algorithm where all estimators of ensemble are decision trees.
 - It combines predictions of these weak tree learners to predict final output.

**NOTE:**  
It can be used **Catboost** for *classification*, *regression*, *ranking*, and other machine learning tasks.

## CatBoost Models at High-Level (High-Level API)

CatBoost provides three different estimators to perform **classification** and **regression** tasks.

 - **CatBoost:**
   - It's a universal estimator which can handle both *classification* and *regression* datasets with settings.
 - **CatBoostRegressor:**
   - It is an estimator with *scikit-learn* like API designed to work with *regression* datasets.
 - **CatBoostClassifier:**
   - It is an estimator with *scikit-learn* like API designed to work with *classification* datasets.

## Why use "CatBoost" over other Python Gradient Boosting libraries?

 - Catboost provided support for handling **categorical** and **text features** of the data without the developer needing to handle them separately.
 - Catboost also provides support for **grid search** and **randomized search** which lets us try out a list of values for parameters to find the best combination of parameters that gives the best results.
 - Catboost algorithm gives quite a **good accuracy** with default parameter settings.
 - Apart from this, catboost also provides support for running the training process on **GPU**. It even lets us run the training process on multiple GPUs with simple configurations.
 - Finally, Catboost provides API in **Python** and **R**.

## "Pool" data structure

The Pool is an internal data structure of catboost that wraps our data and target values. It can make training faster.

 - **Important Parameters Of "Pool()" Constructor:**
   - **data** - It accepts numpy array, pandas dataframe, or list which has features values.
   - **label** - It accepts numpy array, pandas dataframe, or list which has target labels.
   - **cat_features** - It accepts a list of integer specifying indices of data that has categorical features.
   - **text_features** -It accepts a list of integer specifying indices of data that has text features.

Below we have an simple example **Pool data structure**:

[pool-v1.py](src/pool-v1.py)
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.datasets import load_boston

from catboost.utils import eval_metric
from catboost import Pool, CatBoost

import warnings

warnings.simplefilter(action='ignore', category=FutureWarning)


 # Load Boston Dataset from SkLearn Library.
boston = load_boston()

# Divide data into train and test.
X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(
    boston.data,
    boston.target,
    train_size=0.9,
    random_state=123
)

# Encapsulate training data.
pool_train = Pool(
    X_train,
    Y_train,
)

# Encapsulate validate data.
pool_test = Pool(
    X_test,
    Y_test,
)

# CatBoost instance.
booster = CatBoost(
    params={
        'iterations':100,
        'verbose':10,
        'loss_function':'RMSE'
    }
)

# Train the model.
booster.fit(pool_train)
booster.set_feature_names(boston.feature_names) # Set names for all features in the model.

# Make predicts to train and test sets.
train_preds = booster.predict(pool_train)
test_preds = booster.predict(pool_test)

# Show R² to train and test sets.
print("\nTrain R²: %.2f"%eval_metric(Y_train, train_preds, "R2")[0])
print("Test  R²: %.2f"%eval_metric(Y_test, test_preds, "R2")[0])
```

 # Load Boston Dataset from SkLearn Library.

# Divide data into train and test.
X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(
    boston.data,
    boston.target,
    train_size=0.9,
    random_state=123
)

# Encapsulate training data.
train_data = Pool(
    X_train,
    Y_train,
)

# Encapsulate validate data.
test_data = Pool(
    X_test,
    Y_test,
)

# CatBoost instance.
booster = CatBoost(
    params={
        'iterations':100,
        'verbose':10,
        'loss_function':'RMSE'
    }
)

# Train the model.
booster.fit(train_data, eval_set=(test_data))
booster.set_feature_names(boston.feature_names) # Set names for all features in the model.

# Make predicts to train and test sets.
test_preds = booster.predict(test_data)
train_preds = booster.predict(train_data)

print("\nTrain R2 : %.2f"%eval_metric(Y_train, train_preds, "R2")[0])
