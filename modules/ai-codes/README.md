## Project Structure

 - **ai-codes/**
   - Main package directory containing the source code.
    - **algorithms/**
      - Contains implementations of machine learning and deep learning algorithms.
      - **`__init__.py`**
        - Marks the directory as a Python package, enabling direct module imports.
      - **`dl.py`**
        - Implementations of deep learning algorithms.
      - **`ml.py`**
        - Functions and classes for traditional machine learning algorithms.
      - **`utils.py`**
        - Utility functions that support the algorithms.
    - **datasets/**
      - Holds scripts for loading and preprocessing datasets.
      - **`__init__.py`**
        - Marks the datasets directory as a package.
      - **`loader.py`**
        - Functions for loading and managing datasets.
   - **docs/**
     - Contains the detailed documentation of the project, such as usage guides, API references, and technical notes that help developers and users understand how the project works.
     - **`__init__.py`**
       - Marks the datasets directory as a package.
   - **examples/**
     - Holds practical examples and notebooks (e.g., Jupyter Notebooks) demonstrating how to use the algorithms and models provided by the project.
     - **`__init__.py`**
       - Marks the examples directory as a package.
   - **models/**
     - Defines models and neural network structures for training and evaluation.
     - **`__init__.py`**
       - Initializes the models module.
   - **tests/**
     - Contains automated unit and integration tests to ensure code quality and stability.
     - **`__init__.py`**
       - Marks the tests directory as a package.
   - **`__init__.py`**
     - Marks the root (top-level) directory as a Python package, enabling direct module imports.
   - **`main.py`** (Optional)
      - Serves as the entry point for running demonstrations or integrated tests of the project.
   - **`README.md`**
     - Provides an overview of the project, including basic installation instructions, usage examples, and information for contributions or contact.
